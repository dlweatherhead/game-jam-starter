# Starter Kit for Unity Game Jams

This is the source code for a starter kit to help me jump start a game jam using Unity.

#### LICENSE
MIT (see [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt))

#### REQUIRES
Unity 2019.417f1

#### HOW TO
You can download the source, but it is recommended to fork the project for your own repo.
Alternatively you can download and copy Assets/* to your project. This will provide you the required functionality, but may require some Unity packages to be installed.
